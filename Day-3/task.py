# Q1------>
# BMI Calculator with Interpretations
# Add some if/elif/else statements to the BMI calculator so that it interprets the BMI values calculated.

# If the bmi is under 18.5 (not including), print out "underweight"

# If the bmi is between 18.5 (including) and 25 (not including), print out "normal weight"

# If the bmi is 25 (including) or over, print out "overweight"

# Refer to this graphic for help:

# SOLUTION------>
# weight = 85
# height = 1.85

# bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# if bmi < 18.5:
#     print("underweight")
    
# elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
#     print("normal weight")
    
# else:
#     print("overweight")
