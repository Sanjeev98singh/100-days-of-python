# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python challenge! This repository contains my journey through 100 days of learning and coding in Python. Each day, I will complete a coding task, project, or exercise to improve my Python skills.

## Daily Progress

### Day 1: Getting Started
- Installed Python and set up the development environment.
- Learned about Python shell commands.
- Implemented the `len`, `type` functions, and worked with lists.

### Day 2
- Explored PEMDASLR (Order of Operations in Python).
- Used f-strings for formatted strings.
- Practiced rounding numbers with `round()`.
- Learned about public (`sanjeev`), protected (`_sanjeev`), private (`__sanjeev`), and magic variables (`__sanjeev__`).
- Used the `import keyword` to view Python keywords with `keyword.kwlist`.
- Utilized the `id()` function to find the address of an object.
- Worked with base conversion functions.
- Explored string methods: `capitalize()`, `append()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, and `title()`.
- Used `dir(str)` to find methods supported by the string data type.
- Used `help(any_datatype.any_method)` to get descriptions of specific methods.
- Imported the `builtins` module and used `dir(builtins)` to find supported functions and elements.

### Day 3
- Learned about the `pip` package manager.
- Explored built-in and external modules.

### Day 4
- **Base Conversion in Python**: I've recently learned how to perform base conversion in Python. This includes converting numbers between different bases such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.

### Day 5
Explored Complex Data Types, String Data Types and slice[] operator in Python

### Day 6
Fundamental Data Types vs Immutability and type coercion

### Day 7
Difference between Immutability and mutability and brief description about collection related data types

### Day 8
List vs Tuple

### Day 9
All about Tuple and Set

### Day 10
Frozenset, dictionary, range , bytes and bytearray

### Day 11
Revision of previous concepts

### Day 12
None Data Types, Documentation String, ceil and floor and relational operator on ascii values

### Day 13
Revision of previous concepts

### Day 14
python versions and documentation

### Day 15
 Memory management behind the scenes in Python, Sequence of data stored in Python, insert method in Python, fstring in python, pip, modules in Python, pyjokes module in Python and pre-Commpiled Byte code in Python

### Day 16
Brief overview of unittests in Python

### Day 17
real world examples of using variables in Python, code readability for better naming convention of variables in Python

### Day 18
chaining of operational operators in Python, order function to analyse ascii values

### Day 19
equality operators in Python

### Day 20
Generator and Iterator functions

### Day 21
difference between == and is in Python

### Day 22
not operator in Python, Bitwise Complement Operator, import sys from Python module and Shift operator(left and right shift operator)

### Day 23
Nested ternary operator in Python, special operator, identity operator, membership operator, modules, math module, dir module and randint module

### Day 24
eval input function in Python, multiple values in single line in Python, list unpackings in Python, list comprehensions in Python

### Day 25
Command Line Arguments and import argv from sys

### Day 26
Output Statement with separate arguments

### Day 27
Formatted string, Replacement operator

### Day 28
Indentation

### Day 29


## Installation

To install the required Python modules, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to install the necessary modules:

    ```sh
    pip install <module_name>
    ```

Replace `<module_name>` with the name of the module you need to install.

For example, to install `requests`, you would run:

    ```sh
    pip install requests
    ```
