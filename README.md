# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python challenge! This repository contains my journey through 100 days of learning and coding in Python. Each day, I will complete a coding task, project, or exercise to improve my Python skills.

## Daily Progress

### Day 1: Getting Started
- Installed Python and set up the development environment.
- Learned about Python shell commands.
- Implemented the `len`, `type` functions, and worked with lists.

### Day 2
- Explored PEMDASLR (Order of Operations in Python).
- Used f-strings for formatted strings.
- Practiced rounding numbers with `round()`.
- Learned about public (`sanjeev`), protected (`_sanjeev`), private (`__sanjeev`), and magic variables (`__sanjeev__`).
- Used the `import keyword` to view Python keywords with `keyword.kwlist`.
- Utilized the `id()` function to find the address of an object.
- Worked with base conversion functions.
- Explored string methods: `capitalize()`, `append()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, and `title()`.
- Used `dir(str)` to find methods supported by the string data type.
- Used `help(any_datatype.any_method)` to get descriptions of specific methods.
- Imported the `builtins` module and used `dir(builtins)` to find supported functions and elements.

### Day 3
- Learned about the `pip` package manager.
- Explored built-in and external modules.

### Day 3
- **Base Conversion in Python**: I've recently learned how to perform base conversion in Python. This includes converting numbers between different bases such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.

## Installation

To install the required Python modules, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to install the necessary modules:

    ```sh
    pip install <module_name>
    ```

Replace `<module_name>` with the name of the module you need to install.

For example, to install `requests`, you would run:

    ```sh
    pip install requests
    ```
