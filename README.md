# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python challenge! This repository contains my journey through 100 days of learning and coding in Python. Each day I will complete a coding task, project, or exercise to improve my Python skills.

## Daily Progress

### Day 1: Getting Started
- Installed Python and set up the development environment.
- learned more about Python shell commands
- Learned how to implement the len, type functions, and a list

### Day 2:
- PEMDASLR
- fstrings
- RoundOff functions
- public variable(sanjeev),protected variable(_sanjeev),private variable(__sanjeev) and magical variables(__sanjeev__)
- Import Keyword-> keyword.kwlist
- id() function-> to know about the address of the object
- Base Conversion function
- capitalize(), append(), upper(), lower() and title() methods explored
- dir(str) by using the directory string in the python shell we can find any methods which python supports. 
- help(any_datatype.any_any_method) we can find the brief description about that particular method.
- import builtins -> dir(builtins) by using the directory builtins from imported builtins in the python shell we can find any functions and elements which python supports.
